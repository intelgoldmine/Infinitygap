      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information you provide when you create an account (such as name, email, and profile details),
        content you submit to the product (for example research prompts and preferences), and technical data needed
        to run the service (such as device/browser type, approximate region if you enable geo features, and standard
        server logs).
      </p>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <p>
        We use account and usage data to provide and improve Intel GoldMine, personalize your experience, secure the

        according to our infrastructure and provider terms.

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We may share data with subprocessors that host or operate the service (for example cloud and authentication
        providers), when required by law, or to protect rights and safety. We do not sell your personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service, comply with legal

        <li>Opt out of non-essential communications via links in our emails, where applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use industry-standard measures appropriate to the nature of the service. No method of transmission over the
        internet is completely secure.
      </p>

      <h2>International users</h2>
      <p>
        If you access the service from outside the country where our providers operate, your information may be
        transferred and processed in those regions.
